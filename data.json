From this cataclysm was born a unique entity, pure and luminous... you.\n\nArcanthys is a 3D/2D platformer on Android, blending action, narrative, and exploration. Each zone tells the story of the scars left by the Eclipse. It's an indie game with stylized, colorful graphics to contrast with the dark narrative universe.\n\nAs you progress, you'll unlock new magical powers, face creatures deformed by corruption, and encounter the remnants of forgotten civilizations.",
